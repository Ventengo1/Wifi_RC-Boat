# June 12: Brainstorming and Finding Parts

- This is my second project and I decided to make it something more useful than a rocket
- Got inspiration becuase just opened my pool and started maintence and it is super dirty
- Idea:
- 2 servos propel it with solar panels to power it so it can run whenever it is sunny
- Started off by finding parts which for the motors wasn't too dificult
- Spent around 30 minutes on that as my idea of what I was going to do kept changing
- Then worked on finding solar panels
- Issue is that to get 5v 3w solar panel is very difficult
- Also very expensive and they don't really sell pre-soldered ones

- Going to end up using 2 of these to power my servos and basically the enitre thing; https://www.amazon.com/Sunnytech-1-25w-Module-Polysilicon-Charger/dp/B008J9BYY0?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=A38GXV238JJXE&utm_source=chatgpt.com&th=1


**Total time spent: 2.5h**

# June 13: Finishing up finding parts and creating models

- Started off by finding some pvc pipe to use
- Did a bit of reaserch and then decided to use pvc pipes with caps
- And then have pool noddle on them for floatation
- After this found netting
- Simple pool handheld skimmer net which will use for the robot
- In total spend around 30min on this
- Then went on to creating a tinkercad model with the correct dimensions for the robot
- Didn't add all the wiring but added basically everyhting else
- Main model I also created was the solar panel mount which will house all the wires and the switches

- Currently deciding on whether to put a plastic waterproof box or something like this to protect the wires and the swtich
- Probably will which will add about $8-10 to cost
- Current cost in $40
- Because solar panels are expensive and don't trsut aliexpress ones
- Read on reddit and other forums that they tend to be scams
- Just found a box to use (This is a edit to my prior entry)
- It should be about $4 and will help keep everything waterproof and sealed away

  **Total time spent: 2h**

    - 7.4v battery for motors
    - And more to come

  # July 4th: 3d Models
  - Spent the entire time today working on creating the 3d models
  - Created a speed boat with motor mounts and a cover
  - Roughly 7in in length
  - Added a large crevice for all the electronics and mounting place for both motors with propellers
  - Pretty much done now!!!
